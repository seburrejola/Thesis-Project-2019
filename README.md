# Thesis-Project-2019
In this group of codes we have a simulation of a 'free-particle' game of life, with physical and biological components.

We have 4 codes: practica1.py , classes_and_functions.py , lifeparticle_force.py and read_write_txts.py .

The codes 'classes_and_functions.py' and 'lifeparticle_force.py' just have functions that are used in the other two codes.
The code 'practica1.py' is the one that runs the simulation and the interaction between the agents, while it is running the 
simulation, it saves the data in a .txt document that will be readed with the code 'read_write_txts.py'. In this last code
the simulation data y used to create an animation of the system and algo the data is used to obtain plots of the measurement
of the amount of clusters per step and the frequenzy that had each size of cluster in the whole simulation.

All the explanations of the functions, parameters and variables are in their respective codes.
